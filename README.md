# Discord-Plex-LastFM
A bot to pull currently playing song from plex

This bot pulls current playing song from Plex library and displays it as a status message in Discord (similar to spotify).
I created this bot because I no longer pay for spotify and didn't want to appear inactive to friends or the servers I'm in.
If the appropriate metadata is attached to your media, it will scrobble to your Last.FM account, which you can later use to analyze and create your own spotify-wrapped like experience.

Note: copying a status message with automation into your personal status goes against Discord TOS. It is advised to avoid using automation to copy the bot's status.
