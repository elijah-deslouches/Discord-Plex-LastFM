To run the bot in the background on your Plex server, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the Bot on Plex Server in the Background:
Since you're running the bot on a server, the best approach would be to use screen, tmux, or systemd to keep it running in the background even after you log out.

Using screen:
Install screen on your server if it's not installed:
sudo apt-get install screen

Start a new screen session:
screen -S plex-bot

Run your Python script as usual:
python3 app.py

Detach from the screen session by pressing Ctrl+A, then D.
To reattach later, run:
screen -r plex-bot
